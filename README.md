### Current Projects 
  * Interceptor - specialized proxie built to be modular and flexible and easily integrated with other applications that can use the output data.
  * LogicLens - AI leveraged software development, testing and logging repository and analyzer. Built to be modular and easily integrateed into any poroject to speed development by centralizing and organizing application logs and test run output, customizing the visualization of output, and giving a complete view of the AUT availabel to an LLM (local or API) to recieve sugggstions on imporvments and solutions to issues.
  * SigFile - A development process tracking tool, A tool foloowing the usual standards of f;lexability and code quality created to track and record the entire decvelopment process without any gaps. from the descussions and Ideads to the failed attempts and why they failed to the preformance adjustmetns over release optimization all in one cetralized localtion. Designed to work wiht local LLMs that can review the entire process as well as as avoid repeating mistakes! Data from this applicaiton can be exported and used as training or fintuineing data. The possibilitiews are endless! Future imporvmenmt will include securty protocols, automated bug filing and tracking, CI/CD monitoring, and developemtn of plugins to integrate wiht common industry tools (Github Actions, Jira, Bugzilla etc..).   
  * System Monitor - tool sdesigned to track processes, applicaions, resoirce allocation and activities over a period of time and build a history. great for long haul testing and ctaching random applicaiton or system freak outs. Future implementation will include AI leveraging adn hightened security.
