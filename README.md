## Current Projects 
  ### Interceptor  - 
##### Specialized proxy built to be modular and flexible and easily integrated with other applications that can use the output data.
  ### LogicLense - 
##### AI leveraged software development, testing and logging repository and analyzer. Built to be modular and easily integrated into any project to speed development by centralizing and organizing application logs and test run output, customizing the visualization of output, and giving a complete view of the AUT available to an LLM (local or API) to receive suggestions on improvements and solutions to issues.
  ### SigFile- 
##### A development process tracking tool, A tool following the usual standards of flexibility and code quality created to track and record the entire development process without any gaps. from the discussions and Ideas to the failed attempts and why they failed to the performance adjustments over release optimization all in one centralized location. Designed to work with local LLMs that can review the entire process as well as as avoid repeating mistakes! Data from this application can be exported and used as training or fine tuning data. The possibilities are endless! Future improvements will include security protocols, automated bug filing and tracking, CI/CD monitoring, and development of plugins to integrate with common industry tools (Github Actions, Jira, Bugzilla etc..).   
 ### System Monitor - 
##### A tool designed to track processes, applications, resource allocation and activities over a period of time and build a history. great for long haul testing and catching random application or system freak outs. Future implementation will include AI leveraging and heightened security.  *~(Intel and Silicon Macs running Sequoia 15.3 and newer)*
